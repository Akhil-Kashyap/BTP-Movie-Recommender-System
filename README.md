# BTP-Recommendation-System

Due to the advent of new technology and people relying more and more on the Internet, the problem of information overload has increased significantly. Hence, there is a need to process, prioritize, and effectively distribute relevant content to the users. The Recommendation systems are useful in solving the dilemma as it digs through vast amounts of dynamically generated data and  provides consumers with personalized content and services which are significant for the user. We are addressing this issue by implementing a “Recommender Search Model using Autoencoders” so as to recommend movies to users which are significant to them. We are working with the MovieLens dataset which would help us train our model.

# The MovieLens Dataset
The dataset that we are working with is MovieLens, one of the most common datasets that is available on the internet for building a Recommender System. The version of the dataset that we are working with (1M) contains 1,000,209 anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies made by 6,040 MovieLens users who joined MovieLens in 2000
